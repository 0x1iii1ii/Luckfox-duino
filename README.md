# Luckfox-duino
This repo contains a collection of C/C++ library that brings familiar Arduino-style APIs to Luckfox application development. The idea is to create a layer that mimics Arduino APIs (e.g., digitalWrite(), analogRead(), pinMode(), etc.) to help the learning process for those who have already experienced with Arduino to transition into embedded Linux development.
